# simple-math

I was bored, so I made some simple math parser and calculator.

- [x] Arbitrary-length ("big") numbers. (Thanks to library "num")
- [x] Non-whole numbers. (Thanks to library "bigdecimal-rs")
- [x] Negative numbers
- [x] Orders of operations
- [x] Bitwise operators
- [x] Factorial
- [x] Function system
- [ ] Actually implement some functions

EDIT: Ugh, I can't even make a single project without [@tbodt](https://github.com/tbodt) knowing a better solution :P  
This time he told me about recursive parsers :O  
So yeah, huge thanks to him for being such an awesome person!
